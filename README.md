# Hospital-Supplier-Demographic-Analysis
Given purchase order data from the R&amp;D area of a hospital, I used R to perform various statistical techniques to attempt to predict demographic information of suppliers for the next calendar month. Specifically, the demographic information of interest was the percentage of suppliers that are considered minority owned businesses or percentage of suppliers that are owned by women.
